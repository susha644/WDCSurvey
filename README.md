WDCSurvey
=========

WDC survey assignment, a simple survey app to record a survey against your org contacts in salesforce.

The app minVersion has been set to 11 for security reasons to make sure we use built-in encryption in latest android devices but, 
should be able to support lower versions if needed because of the use of support libraries.

To Build in Eclipse
===================

In case you see errors please make sure you have these two dependent library projects 
in your workspace and update the project properties to point to the correct versions.

- SalesforceMobileSDK for Android
- android support v7 appcompat
